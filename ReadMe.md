This is an R project containing the code required to recreate an evaluation of 
coverage probability for selected confidence intervals for paired binomial 
risk difference, relative risk, and conditional odds ratio.
Includes complete enumeration of coverage probability, left and right sided 
non-coverage, interval location index (MNCP/NCP), plus associated summary statistics
and plots
## Instructions
- Open the cpplot.Rproject file, then:
- devtools::load.all(".")
- then run selected code as required from within 'create_outputs.R'
- Note the calculations may take some time...
